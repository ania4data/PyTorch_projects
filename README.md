# PyTorch_projects

codes and excersies from lectures given by Sung Kim, Hong Kong University of Technology
as well as other projects following https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch and http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/
and other random projects I wanted to do with pytorch, including:

Plant disease classification custom net/Alexnet, text generation using RNN/LSTM/GRU, Siamese network with AT&T faces and omniglot, using Koch et. al paper and also contrast loss
