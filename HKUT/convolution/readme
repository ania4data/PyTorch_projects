testing the CIFAR10 with or without convolution, at most only using linear FC can do overfit on train and get to ~50% on test, after 50 epochs, with conv (custom) 2 conv, and
3 fc with dropout you get the 66% after 10 epochs.

using dropout generally show undefitting in accuracy of the training but in eval or test, accuracy recovered, dropout (like ensemble of mthods). SGD works best vs. Adam for 
CIFAR10 !
